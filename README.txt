# Portfolio Website

Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio! I created this website to show a few of my data science projects, demonstrating my knowledge and skills in various aspects of data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization. This portfolio was created using Quarto.

## Projects {#projects}

### [Polynomial Regression Analysis]

-   **Description:** This project explores the concepts of overfitting and model selection using polynomial regression on generated data. It includes data generation, model building, training, evaluation using techniques like train-test split and Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation, and visualization. The project also emphasizes the creation and documentation of functions, noting the importance of clear and maintainable code.
-   **Libraries Used:** caret, ggplot2.

### [Web Scraping Examples]

-   **Description:** This project includes two examples of data scraping from the web. The first example scrapes book data from a practice website, demonstrating how to extract book titles, prices, and ratings. The second example extracts baby names data from a government statistics page, showing how to handle and clean tabular data.
-   **Technologies Used:** rvest, ggplot2, dplyr.

### [Clustering Analysis]

-   **Description:** This project performs clustering analysis on the USArrests dataset using k-means and hierarchical clustering techniques. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and visualization of clustering results.
-   **Libraries Used:** ggplot2, GGally, cluster, dplyr, factoextra, dendextend, gridExtra.

## Directory Structure {#directory-structure}

The project structure is tailored for building a data science portfolio website using Quarto, and it differs from typical data science projects. Below is an overview of the most relevant parts of the directory:

-   **`_site/`**: Contains the generated website files.
-   **`images/`**: Stores images used in the website.
-   **`projects/`**: Contains folders for the individual projects. (Note: the project is the website as a whole, and not the projects uploaded in the website, so we did not refactor each project's code.)
-   **`.gitignore`**: Specifies files and folders to be ignored by Git.
-   **`index.qmd`**: Quarto markdown file for the homepage of the website.
-   **`projects.qmd`**: Quarto markdown file listing all projects from the projects/ folder.
-   **`_quarto.yml`**: Organizes the structure of the website.
