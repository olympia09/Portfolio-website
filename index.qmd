Hello! I'm \[CID 02518535\]. I completed my undergraduate studies in Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Cyprus and am currently pursuing my master's degree in Statistics at Imperial College London. I created this portfolio to demonstrate my growing knowledge and skills in data science.

I invite you to explore my detailed projects where I showcase the methodologies and techniques I have learned. Visit the [Projects Page](projects.qmd) to learn more. I'm always excited to connect with fellow data enthusiasts, professionals, and potential collaborators. Feel free to reach out to me using the contact buttons below.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio!
